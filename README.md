# media-upload
Simple Multipart Http Upload tool that lets you upload stuff on a webserver, 
comes with very basic bearer auth implementaiton, work in progress. 

On top it removes exif information from images and videos by using rexiv2 and ffmpeg.

However, it does not serve the uploaded files, for this you need to setup an additional webserver.
